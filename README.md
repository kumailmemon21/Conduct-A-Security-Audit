# Conduct-A-Security-Audit

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to conduct a security audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist for the fictional company, Botium Toys. To achieve this, I first reviewed the provided scope, goals, and risk assessment report, focusing on the assets managed by the IT department. Using the information from these documents and the Controls Categories guide, I then completed the checklist by answering each question with “yes” or “no,” determining the company's compliance and security measures. The recommendations section was optional but I used this to suggest improvements. This process helped me to evaluate the company’s security posture and ensure it meets necessary standards and regulations.
